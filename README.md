# How to Code: Simple Data - Problem Set Solutions
Welcome to my repository showcasing solutions to the problem sets from the "How to Code Simple Data" course by the University of British Columbia on edX. This course, rooted in the principles of "How to Design Programs" (HTDP) 2nd Edition by Matthias Felleisen, Daniel P. Friedman, and Robert Bruce Findler, has been an enriching journey.

## Highlights:
 - Comprehensive Solutions: Find detailed solutions to all problem sets in the course, excluding optional and bonus challenges.
 - Organized Structure: Each solution file is intuitively named, corresponding to the respective problem set and problem number.
## Important Notes:
 - Educational Purpose: These solutions are shared with the intention of aiding learning. They may not be flawless or the sole approach to problem-solving.
 - Use Responsibly: While these solutions can serve as a valuable reference, I encourage you to use them as a launchpad for your own exploration. Avoid blindly copying and pasting without understanding the underlying concepts.
 - Stay Updated: The course content may evolve, with possible updates to problems or grading criteria. Regularly consult the course materials for the most recent information.
Feel free to explore and leverage these solutions as you navigate through the intriguing world of "How to Code Simple Data." Happy coding!
